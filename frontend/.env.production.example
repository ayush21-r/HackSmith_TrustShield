# Frontend Environment Variables for Production
# Copy this to your Vercel environment settings

# API Base URL - Point to your Render backend
VITE_API_URL=https://hacksmith-trustshield.onrender.com

# Note: 
# - For local development, axios will use /api (proxied in vite.config.js)
# - For production on Vercel, set VITE_API_URL to your Render backend URL
# - Do NOT include /api in the URL - the client.js adds that automatically
